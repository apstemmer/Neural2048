# Neural2048
Practising Neural Networks by trying to create a 2048 bot

Layout of the project is as follows:
The front end calls an API in main.js with the state of the board. This in turn runs a Child process which allows Python to calculate the next step for optimal gameplay.

TODO:
-Define API
-train/create Neural net
-add controls to front-end
-create animation for blocks
